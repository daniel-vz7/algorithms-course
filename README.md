# Algorithms course exercises
In this repository, you'll find algorithms examples as you can find them on [Algorithms by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

## Startup

### Requirements
- node v12

### Instructions

To run these files you'll need to first clone this repo into your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/daniel-vz7/algorithms-course.git
$ cd /algorithms-course
```

## Examples

### Karatsuba

To run the Karatsuba algorithm you can use the next command instruction

```
$ node karatsuba {x} {y}
```

Where _x_ and _y_ are integers

Note: This is only for educational purposes, if you want to get the same result in a production environment, I'll recommend you that you leave this task to the engine since it approaches in a much more efficient way
